# C Coursework - Marker Finding Robot

## Project Description

Hello, and welcome to my C Coursework project! Here, our main task was the create a robot that would search for markers in a 10x10 grid and bring them back to its home square. I was able to draw the grid, robot, and the type of grid squares using the graphics files (graphics.c and graphics.h) provided.

Out of the six stages provided, I was able to make it up to stage 5. Out of all the features I implemented, I would say that the linked list that functioned as a stack was the most difficult to implememt. I had to use multiple sources (cited below) to understand how to create the linked list. Finding out how to feed the direction that the robot was facing in and the grid square it was on into the stack was also tricky. I hope to learn more about the robot's logic to be able to implement stage 6 properly.
